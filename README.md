# ARCHBLOXLauncher
A launcher for ARCHBLOX. Client Downloader: https://github.com/Thomasluigi07/ARCHBLOXBootstrapper
## How this works
- First, it gets the latest version of ARCHBLOX (a string)
- Then, it asks if you want to Join or Host
- Finally, you enter your options and BAM! you're playing da game! (unless you haven't installed the game)
I'm new to C# so I hope this will be good. My code is pretty oof.
